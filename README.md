# Minimalistic Web

Many websites are overloaded with features. This effectively makes them less 
usable. This project aims on providing templates for stripping websites down 
to the most necessary stuff.

The templates are designed for the [Privoxy](http://www.privoxy.org/) web proxy.

__Note__: Templates are not executed for websites you access over HTTPS
and the templates are designed to be used in conjunciton with an AdBlock Browser Addon!


# Installation

Install Privoxy. For Ubuntu e.g. `$ sudo apt-get install privoxy`.

Install an [AdBlock Browser Addon](http://adblockplus.org/de/firefox)! 

Clone the repo `$ git clone https://github.com/cmichi/minimalistic-web.git`.

Append to `/etc/privoxy/config`:

	actionsfile /path-to-repo/minimalistic.action
	filterfile /path-to-repo/minimalistic.filter

Restart Privoxy `$ sudo /etc/init.d/privoxy restart` (Ubuntu) and be sure
your browser is configured to use the proxy. Et voil√†!
