# Minimalistic Web

Many websites are overloaded with features. This effectively makes them less 
usable. This project aims on providing templates for stripping websites down 
to the most necessary stuff.
I have written a description of the concept down 
[here](http://micha.elmueller.net/2013/04/the-aesthetics-of-simplicity/).

Before/After screenshots are posted on this tumblr: 
[minimalistic-web.tumblr.com](http://minimalistic-web.tumblr.com).


__Note__: The templates 

 * are designed for the [Privoxy](http://www.privoxy.org/) web proxy
 * are not executed for websites you access over HTTPS
 * are designed to be used in conjunciton with an AdBlock Browser Addon


# Installation

Install and configure Privoxy. For Ubuntu e.g. `$ sudo apt-get install privoxy`.

Install AdBlock, either as an 
[AdBlock Browser Addon](http://adblockplus.org/de/firefox) or as templates
for Privoxy (I followed the instructions provided
[here](https://github.com/skroll/privoxy-adblock)).

Clone the repo `$ git clone https://github.com/cmichi/minimalistic-web.git`.

Append to `/etc/privoxy/config`:

	actionsfile /path-to-repo/minimalistic.action
	filterfile /path-to-repo/minimalistic.filter

Restart Privoxy `$ sudo /etc/init.d/privoxy restart` (Ubuntu) and make sure
your browser is configured to use the proxy. Et voil√†!

In case of the templates not being loaded you might have to move them into
a subdirectory of /etc/privoxy/.


# Supported Sites so far

 * MediaWiki: you need to add the URI of the Wiki to `minimalistic.action`,
   german and english Wikipedia are there as a default.
 * spiegel.de
 * golem.de
 * ~~zeit.de~~ (zeit stylesheet was changed in the meantime, needs rework)


# ToDo 

 * create gallery/showcase of berfore/after templating of websites
 * Ideas for sites to "redesign": soup.io fullscreen view, wetter.de
